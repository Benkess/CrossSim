### ðŸ“¦ **Project Purpose: Cross-Simulator Scenario Generation Toolkit for Robotic Navigation**

This codebase provides a modular, extensible set of tools for generating, editing, and exporting robotic simulation environments and navigation scenarios. It is designed specifically to support **robotics researchers** conducting experiments in navigation and crowd interaction.

The toolkit serves two main purposes:

1. **Scenario and Environment Creation**
   It includes both GUI-based and programmatic tools to create static maps, populate them with dynamic agents and robots, and define navigation goals and behaviors.

2. **Cross-Simulator Export and Interoperability**
   Scenarios are saved in a unified, simulator-agnostic format, making them easily exportable to multiple robotics simulation platforms and tools.

### ðŸ§© **Key Components**

* **Interactive Tools (CLI/GUI)**
  Enable manual and procedural creation of environments and crowd scenarios.

* **Scenario Representation Framework**
  Provides a persistent, extensible format for storing scenario data, including maps, agents, robot configurations, and metadata.

* **Export Modules**
  Convert the internal scenario format into configurations for:

  * **Simulators:** Gazebo (Classic/Ignition), Isaac Sim, Flatland
  * **Navigation Stacks & Tools:** ROS 2 Nav2, HuNavSim, Arena-Rosnav

### ðŸ§ª **Intended Use**

This toolkit helps researchers:

* Rapidly generate reproducible simulation setups.
* Run cross-platform navigation experiments.
* Build datasets for benchmarking or machine learning.
* Share standardized scenarios across research groups.
