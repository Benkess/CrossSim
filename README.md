# Cross-Simulator Scenario Generation Toolkit for Robotic Navigation

This repository contains a modular set of tools for **generating**, **editing**, and **exporting** robotic simulation environments and scenarios. Designed for **robotics researchers**, the toolkit enables rapid creation of reproducible experiments in robot navigation, human-robot interaction, and crowd simulation.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Scenario & Environment Creation**
   Tools to help researchers define navigation scenarios, including static maps, dynamic agents, and robot start/goal states.

2. **Cross-Simulator Interoperability**
   Unified scenario format that can be exported to multiple popular robotics simulators and toolchains.

## Key Components

### 🔧 Interactive Tools

* GUI and CLI utilities to:

  * Draw 2D maps
  * Place static and dynamic obstacles
  * Add robots and agents with behaviors

### 🗂 Scenario Representation Framework

* Persistent, simulator-agnostic format (YAML/JSON)
* Stores:

  * Static maps (2D occupancy, 3D layouts)
  * Robots and agent configurations
  * Navigation goals and behavior profiles
  * Scenario metadata (name, tags, seed, resolution)

### 📤 Export Modules

* Export to simulation and navigation backends:

  * **Simulators:**

    * Gazebo Classic / Ignition
    * Isaac Sim (USD or Python API)
    * Flatland (ROS 2 fork)
  * **Navigation Tools:**

    * Nav2
    * HuNavSim
    * Arena-Rosnav

## 👥 Intended Audience

* Robotics researchers developing and benchmarking navigation algorithms.
* Developers working on simulation platforms for multi-agent interaction.
* Students and educators building reproducible robotics experiments.
